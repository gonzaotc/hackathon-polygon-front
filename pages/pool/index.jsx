								for the prize. With continental qualification

								brings fans together around the passion and love
								for the game. The best part? you could be one of
								them! On top of this, you will have the
								opportunity to live a 7 day-long experience at
								Qatar! Seize the trip with Desert Safari
								excursion with Camel Ride, Sand Boarding &
								Inland Sea Tour in Doha! You will be picked up
								from the 5 star hotel in a cozy 4WD vehicle for
								the Doha Desert Safari. Our guide will drive you
								towards the desert terrain of Qatar. You will be
								having an incredible photo-stop at the coastal
								route adjacent to the Sealine Beach. Once you
								have enjoyed the photo session, hop onto a camel
								for experiencing a mesmerizing ride. The guide
								will adjust the tyre pressure in order to make
								your off-roading smooth. Feel the thrills of a
								rollercoaster ride as the vehicle conquers the
								huge sand dunes while dune bashing. Try out
								sandboarding by gliding across the sea of sand
								with a surfboard provided. After the desert
								adventures, move on to the scenic region of the
								Inland Sea at Khor Al Adaid. Have a photo-stop
								here at the shores of the Inland Sea and enjoy
								the breathtaking sights. You can see the border
								region of Saudi Arabia and behold the rare
								sceneries of land and sea. You will then be
								dropped off at the hotel. Sound crazy, right?
								And the craziest part: No donation or payment is
								necessary to enter or win this sweepstakes. Only
								by the stake of your tokens!
