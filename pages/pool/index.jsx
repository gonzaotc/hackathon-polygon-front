									<b>Ready to be parte of the most</b> prestigious tournament in
									the world?
								</p>
								<p className='text-white'>
									Taking place quadrennially, the FIFA Men's World Cup T
									sees 32 nations compete against each other for the prize.
									With continental qualification pathways leading to an
									exciting finals event, it brings fans together around the
									passion and love for the game. The best part? you could
									be one of them!
									On top of this, you will have the opportunity to live a 7
									day-long experience at Qatar! Seize the trip with Desert
									Safari excursion with Camel Ride, Sand Boarding &
									Inland Sea Tour in Doha! You will be picked up from the
									5 star hotel in a cozy 4WD vehicle for the Doha Desert
									Safari. Our guide will drive you towards the desert terrain
									of Qatar. You will be having an incredible photo-stop at
									the coastal route adjacent to the Sealine Beach. Once
									you have enjoyed the photo session, hop onto a camel for
									experiencing a mesmerizing ride. The guide will adjust the
									tyre pressure in order to make your off-roading smooth.
									Feel the thrills of a rollercoaster ride as the vehicle
									conquers the huge sand dunes while dune bashing. Try
									out sandboarding by gliding across the sea of sand with a
									surfboard provided. After the desert adventures, move on
									to the scenic region of the Inland Sea at Khor Al Adaid.
									Have a photo-stop here at the shores of the Inland Sea
									and enjoy the breathtaking sights. You can see the border
									region of Saudi Arabia and behold the rare sceneries of
									land and sea. You will then be dropped off at the hotel.
									Sound crazy, right? And the craziest part: No donation or
									payment is necessary to enter or win this sweepstakes.
									Only by the stake of your tokens!
